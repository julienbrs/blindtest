Commit: 4b55d35
Notes: Implemented REVEAL → LOADING transition when clicking "Chanson suivante". Updated NEXT_SONG action in useGameState reducer to reset timerRemaining to config.timerDuration (added timerDuration param to action type). Added effect in game page that detects when status is 'loading' with no currentSong and triggers loadRandomSong. Unified loading behavior for both initial game start and subsequent song transitions. Reset audioReadyForSongId to null when loading new song to prevent race conditions. Added 7 new tests for REVEAL → LOADING behavior (1 in useGameState.test.ts for timer reset, 6 in page.test.tsx for loading state UI). All 343 tests pass.

=== Issue 8.3: Ajouter un son de mauvaise réponse ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-18T05:45:00Z
Status: COMPLETED
Commit: 4c6c2f9
Notes: Implemented incorrect answer sound using Web Audio API in useWrongAnswerEffect hook. Created playIncorrectSound function that generates a descending "whomp" tone (~0.4s) using three oscillators: main descending sawtooth (200Hz→80Hz), sub-bass sine (80Hz→40Hz), and brief initial click for clarity. Sound plays immediately on incorrect validation, synchronized with shake animation. Sound plays even when reduced motion is preferred (only visual effects disabled). Added AudioContext cleanup on unmount. Created 7 comprehensive tests for sound functionality. All 543 tests pass.

=== Issue 8.4: Ajouter un son de fin de timer ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-18T06:00:00Z
Status: COMPLETED
Commit: b793600
Notes: Implemented timeout sound using Web Audio API in Timer component. Created a descending "time's up" buzzer sound with 3 oscillators: main sawtooth (400Hz→150Hz), sub-bass sine (100Hz→50Hz), and square buzz (200Hz→80Hz). Sound duration ~0.5s at 0.5 volume. Sound plays exactly when timer transitions from > 0 to 0 (detected using prevRemainingRef). Added optional onTimeout callback prop for external event handling. Handles browser autoplay policy by resuming suspended AudioContext. Added AudioContext cleanup on unmount. Created 8 comprehensive tests for sound functionality covering transition detection, no sound on mount at 0, sound plays only once, reset behavior, callback invocation, and oscillator creation. All 551 tests pass.

=== Issue 8.5: Ajouter un tick-tock pour le timer ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-18T06:10:00Z
Status: COMPLETED
Commit: b8cd5d2
Notes: Implemented tick-tock sound for timer using Web Audio API. Tick sound plays at each second of countdown using sine wave oscillator (~80ms duration). Added tick-tock effect (two sounds) when remaining <= 5 seconds for added urgency. Volume intensifies as time decreases (0.2 at 5s to 0.5 at 1s). Pitch also increases slightly in final 3 seconds for urgency effect. Sound is subtle but audible, not distracting. Created 9 comprehensive tests for tick-tock functionality (559 tests total pass).

=== Issue 8.6: Créer un hook useSoundEffects ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-18T10:56:00Z
Status: COMPLETED
Commit: a676931
Notes: Created centralized useSoundEffects hook for managing all game sounds via Web Audio API. Hook provides methods for all sound effects: buzz, correct, incorrect, timeout, tick (with intensity based on remaining seconds), and reveal. Added volume control (0-1 range with clamping) and mute functionality. All sounds generated using oscillators for low latency. AudioContext is created lazily and reused across calls. Handles browser autoplay policy by resuming suspended context. Proper cleanup on unmount. Created comprehensive test suite with 29 tests covering all methods, mute, volume, AudioContext handling, and callback stability. All 588 tests pass.

=== Issue 8.7: Ajouter une option mute effets sonores ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-18T11:06:00Z
Status: COMPLETED
Commit: bdf4814
Notes: Added SFX mute toggle button in game header with speaker icons (SpeakerWaveIcon/SpeakerXMarkIcon from Heroicons). Implemented localStorage persistence for sfx_muted state. Connected all game sound effects to the centralized useSoundEffects hook by adding optional onPlaySound callbacks to BuzzerButton, Timer, useCorrectAnswerCelebration, and useWrongAnswerEffect. Toggle button shows different aria-label based on mute state and includes "SFX" label on larger screens. Music playback via AudioPlayer remains unaffected by SFX mute. Created 8 comprehensive tests for mute toggle functionality. All 596 tests pass.

=== Issue 8.8: Gérer le volume principal ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-18T11:15:00Z
Status: COMPLETED
Commit: a0b38a1
Notes: Added music volume slider control in game header. Implemented volume prop in AudioPlayer component with real-time volume changes via useEffect. Volume is clamped to 0-1 range for safety. Added MusicalNoteIcon and percentage display (0-100%). Volume state is persisted in localStorage as music_volume. Volume slider uses step of 0.1 for smooth control. Added 7 tests for AudioPlayer volume prop and 15 tests for game page volume control UI. All 617 tests pass.

=== Issue 9.1: Adapter le layout pour mobile ===
Timestamp: 2026-01-18T11:22:00Z
Status: COMPLETED
Commit: fe8db77
Notes: Implemented mobile-first responsive layout from 320px to 1920px. Added responsive sizing to all game components: homepage (title, icons, padding), game page (header, controls, volume slider), SongReveal (cover 48→64 responsive), Timer (circle 24→32 responsive), BuzzerButton (32→48 responsive), GameControls (buttons, spacing), ScoreDisplay (compact on mobile). Volume slider hidden on very small screens. No horizontal overflow. Updated 5 test files for new responsive class selectors. All 617 tests pass.
